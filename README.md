# PEL-Convergence
Comparison of the convergent properties of the PEL and Canonical Ensembles as they reach states of equilibrium. 

The PEL and Canonical Ensemble main codes are the programs that run the actual ensembles and outputs data to .out files. These .out files can be named as desired, explaining which code is being saved as well as for how long (and other desired details such as move size and density). As an example, for the PEL ensemble using nonbiased trial moves sampled from a uniform distribution with a move size equivalent to a distance of 0.1 units and run for an equivalent temperature of T*=1 for 200,000 MC steps, the output file will look like: Nonbias_PEL_200000_Uniform_delta_0.1_T_1.out. By convention of the timeline when working on this project, the canonical ensemble was developed first as the standard Metropolis Monte Carlo sampling method. A number of models were tested in the making of this program, some with small numbers of particles and some starting off in random configurations, as opposed to the standard FCC lattice. A number of different densities were tested as well. As a result, these output files are named by the following: Metropolis_Large_MC_FCC_50000_RDF_5000_rho_1.2_delta_0.1_T_1.out, which just means that this is a canonical ensemble starting at an FCC lattice with 256 particles, run for 50,000 MC steps with 5,000 RDF calculation steps, a density of 1.2, a move step of 0.1 units and run at a temperature of T*=1. In the case of both the canonical and PEL ensembles, positions are printed out for RDF and energy calculculations every 10 MC steps. So, for a run of 50,000 MC steps, there will be 5,000 time slices for the RDF and energy calculations.
